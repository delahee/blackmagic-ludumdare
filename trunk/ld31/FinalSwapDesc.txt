Final Swap reloads the concept of final fantasy's active time battle!
Defend your healer, attack the monsters and take advantage of your blackmage to successfully p0wn the final boss!

Your character's actions are automatic, you only have to place the right character in front of the right monster.
Select a character, then move it left or right from his position.
Take care of your gauge as well as your opponent's ones.
Manage your team, and you'll be victorious !

The sun and moon represent the difficulty, at night, monsters are much more stronger.
Elements can boost your elemental attacks or defences, but be aware that your foe can take advantage of it also. 

Thank you for playing!
